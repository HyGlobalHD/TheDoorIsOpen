Cancels some disconnection events, to allow the user to play. 


### Cancelled Events:

        disconnectionScreen.serverFull
        disconnectionScreen.invalidName
        disconnectionScreen.invalidSkin
        disconnectionScreen.noReason

At the moment, these are the only events cancelled. The reason why I am not including the Server / Client outdated evemts, are because if. I imclude them, it could corrupt the server. I havent tested them yet.
